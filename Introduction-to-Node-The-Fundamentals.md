## 1. Using the node.js REPL shell

> In this lesson, you will learn how to use the interactive Node.js REPL (Read - Evaluate - Print - Loop) shell. The REPL shell allows you to enter javascript directly into a shell prompt and have the results evaluated by the node.js engine immediately. This is extremely useful for testing, debugging, or experimenting with new features to understand how they work. Topics covered include creating variables, functions, the reserved underscore ( _ ) character, REPL commands as well as saving and loading your session to prevent losing work.

## 2. Understanding Callbacks in Node.js

> In this lesson you will learn what callbacks are, how to use them and why we use them in our Node applications. We start with a simple javascript function and build a second function that uses it as a callback to understand the basic operation of a callback. From there, we create a few more functions that help illustrate how using callbacks can help us keep our code legible and organized as well as allowing us to use generic functions that can bring in extra functionality when needed via the callback.

## 3. The noe.js process object

> In this lesson, we introduce the process object, part of then node.js global namespace. The process object is extremely useful for identifying information about the runtime environment of your node app such as the version of node, the arguments passed to the node executable, the current working directory, and the nextTick function. All of these are discussed and illustrated with examples in this lesson.
